This is a catch-all collection of miscellaneous configuration tips. Feel free to
pick and choose:

#### Dotfiles
I'll be keeping all of my configuration files in a repo on github (link pending). I'd encourage you to poke around and steal anything that looks useful.

#### Remap Caps Lock to Control
Under Settings -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys. Pretty much essential if you're going to be using vim.

#### Add your code directory to favorites
You'll probably end up there a lot. Finder -> Preferences -> Sidebar or drag the relevant folder over.

### Set your git config message editor
Vim is awesome and I'd encourage you to learn it someday. This is not that day, however. `git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`

### Use a different shell
Bash is great and available pretty much everywhere, but there are alternatives. I'm particularly partial to [zsh](http://www.slideshare.net/jaguardesignstudio/why-zsh-is-cooler-than-your-shell-16194692), which is more-or-less a superset of bash. [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is a collection of plugins that make zsh fairly awesome right out of the box.
