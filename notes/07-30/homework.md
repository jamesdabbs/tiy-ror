### Github

Add your previous homework to your homework repo and
push it to Github

### 0. Koans

Continue on the path to enlightenment. It is a long road.

### 0.5 Guessing Game Spec

Finish the last spec in the guessing game. Any other improvements to make?

### 1. Code Review

Take a look over the other class members' homework
from yesterday. Find a solution you don't understand
(either a problem you struggled with, or a solution
that is significantly different from yours), and talk
that problem over with its author. What did you learn
from their approach?

### 2. Quiz

You should be able to specify questions (~5-10) like so:

```
# Preferably something with better answers ...
Questions = [
  {
     question: "Why did the chicken cross the road?",
     choices: [
       "Why does anyone do anything?",
       "To get to the other side",
       "Something something something YOUR MOM",
       "Mu"
     ],
     answer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "...",
    ...
  }
]
```

Then running `ruby quiz.rb` should display the questions
one at a time in random order, ask the user for input,
and display their score when done. Bonus: display which
questions the user got right / wrong with answers at the
end.

### 3. Letter counter

Write a letter counter that takes a string and returns
a hash showing how many times each letter shows up in
that strings. Bonus: how many t's are in this file?

### 4. Test-drive the Hangman Game
