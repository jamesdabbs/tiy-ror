# Ruby on Rails @ The Iron Yard
## July 2014

This repo is a collection of notes and documents for the course. Of particular
interest:

* [syllabus.md](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/tiy-ror/blob/master/syllabus.md) - the course syllabus
* [tips](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/tiy-ror/blob/master/tips.md) - miscellaneous computer setup tips
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/tiy-ror/tree/master/dotfiles) - all of the config files that I'm using while teaching. I'd encourage you to poke around these and steal anything that looks useful.
