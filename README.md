# Ruby on Rails @ The Iron Yard
## July 2014

This repo is a collection of notes and documents for the course. Of particular
interest:

* [syllabus.md]() - the course syllabus
* [tips]() - miscellaneous computer setup tips
* [dotfiles]() - all of the config files that I'm using while teaching. I'd
  encourage you to poke around these and steal anything that looks useful.
